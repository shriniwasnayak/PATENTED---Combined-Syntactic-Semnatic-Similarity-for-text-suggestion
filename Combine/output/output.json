Yes, I could use something like coderunner, but I want to actually debug using VSCode debugging tools, not just run my script. I have searched the entire settings.json default file for such a setting, expecting something like \"python.pythonUnbuffered = True\", but nothing exists.   Here is my project's settings.json file which isn't that exciting.  I'm expecting I would set the unbuffered option in there somewhere if I knew the correct parameter. I expect there is a setting somewhere to run python -u but I can't find it. ",
