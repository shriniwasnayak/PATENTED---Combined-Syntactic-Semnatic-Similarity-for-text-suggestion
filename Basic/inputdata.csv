Usually at traffic it autoscales up to 14 m4.large EC2 instance and the response of time of the apis would be around 80 ms for 12k rpm load. We recently moved to AWS ECS, where each task had 2 containers (Nginx 
+ application) and also updated to node12. Now we have around 160 tasks (100 CPU unit for each Nginx + 100 CPU unit for application inside a task) running with 16 same m4.large instances. But the response time increased to 250 ms. In EC2 architecture which we used earlier took GET Elasticache Redis operation around 6ms whereas in ECS when load is high the Redis takes 70ms for the same operation.

57731970,various issues when setting up visualvm remote JVM connection with jstatd,"statd on remote machine may not be starting up correctly and visualvm user interface does not add connections. On the remote machine, I created a policy file for jstatd: I then execute jstatd: ./jstatd -p 1199 -J-Djava.security.policy=/home/jonathan/jstatd.policy It seems to be running and there are no errors which I got when not specifying a port number or policy file. In visualvm, I'm able to add the remote host but when I try to create a jstatd connection and fill the information, when clicking ""ok"", the popup just disappears. No errors, no connections under the node, no nothing. I enabled logging and there are no errors. My questions:
1. Does jstatd REQUIRES an rmiregistry to work? Not specifying a port, will it attempt to connect to a default one (on port 1099)?
2. Running netstat doesn't show any binding on port 1199 which I've designated.
