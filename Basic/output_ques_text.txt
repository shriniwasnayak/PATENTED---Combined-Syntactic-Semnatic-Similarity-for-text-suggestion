I have a problem with the effect where I call a service chain and generates an infinite loop of calls.
The component generates a dispatch
The Effect intercepts the Action and executes the Builder service where inside it runs the Http service that generates an Http call. With the HTTP response I get the http observabke back to the Builder Service and in turn always returns an observer to the effect. The effect creates the positive or negative action.

I have wrote a program using peerjs in Ionic 3. I can run them successfully in computer browsers and computer android emulator (successfully connecting other peers and send/receive messages). However, I found there are no connection to cloud server when I am testing it in an android device. This is the result from Chrome DevTools: this.peer.on('open', ...) is not fired. And I have also logged the created "Peer" object.
the socket property is undefined, _id is null. So, I guess its the connection problem to the cloud server. Anyone has idea? Thanks.
